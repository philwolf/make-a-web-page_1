				Are Computers Intelligent?
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Absolutely <span class="bold">NOT</span>! Computers are incredibly stupid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why you might ask? Great question! That's because computers have no room for interpretation. They do <span class="italic">exactly</span> what they are told to do.

				What Are All Those Lesser Than and Great Than Symbols Used For?
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Those interesting lesser and greater symbols is what we use to code. They essentially hold 'tags'. Most of the time we need an opening tag and a closing tag. Although there are sometimes void tags such as the br tag.
				</p>
				<p>
					 We put symbols such as b or em (both inline, check Lesson 2) or div or p (block, also check Lesson 2)inside of them and they then produce a different result.

				Tree of Knowledge
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					As mentioned in the course, it is important to note, that CSS and HTML are both "languages". HTML controls the structure while CSS controls the style. A DOM, is the tree structure of the page.  
				</p>
				<p>
					When coding, it is best to think of relationships like that of a tree hierachy system. The browser takes an HTML tag and turns it into an element in the tree because of the DOM.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I mean by that is that on the same branch there are siblings, when we go up the branch there are the parents. This is the <span class=italic>parent child relationship</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also have an uncle branch that is at the parents line. For this to happen it has to have the same <span class="bold">ancestors</span> (or root). Each of these nodes represent either text or images or videos.

				Inline and Block
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Tags can be either <span class="italic">inline</span> or <span class="bold">block</span>, the latter meaning that the code creates an invisible box around it. Examples of <span class="italic">Inline tags</span> are em and b. Example of <span class="bold">Block tag</span> are div an p.

				Structure and Repeat After Me
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					If you have a good structure within your html code, you will save a ton of time not repeating yourself when styling in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS allows us to avoid repetition and not repeating yourself is critical to writing good code.
				</p>
				<p>
					A bit more detail...You can div class an item and then control the style in CSS. This allows you not to have to repeat yourself as much. Anything within that class will have a rule. If you Span Class, then you need to say what it does in CSS, but that whole class will be the same, thus saving time and less likelyhood of errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					A bit more about CSS. As the course specifies, it can be thought of as a search and replace tool. You identify a class or tag that you want to match and then tell it what you want it to do or what property values you want to change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important fact about CSS, as mentioned in the course, is that order matters. As you move down the list you can overwrite previous definitions.
				</p>
				<p>
					To understand what I mean by the fact that order matters, I have set the font for the body as Times, but with the h1 (which is found in the body) I have said that this rule does not apply and instead apply Helvetica. If I did not do that, then the body would not have been in Times or the h1 would not of been in Helvetica.

				The Box Model
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Box sizes are adjusted in css. There are four components to a box. Starting from inside to outside, content, padding, borders, and margins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a % will allow the screen size to be adjusted without affecting the layout of your boxes. Each box is an element.
